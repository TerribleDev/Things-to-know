Big ol' checklist of things to know to become a webdeveloper. Mostly for my wife whom wants to get into programming, but could be for anyone entering. This is mostly focused on a web developer role.

Here is a skill legend, if these are not on line items they are on headers of sections

- :no_entry_sign: You shouldn't have to know this, but its worth knowing about
- :star: Something you should know of, and its basic applications
- :sparkles: You should know how this works for most use cases, and be able to execute with only minimal bingling
- :dizzy: You should be a **master** of this topic
